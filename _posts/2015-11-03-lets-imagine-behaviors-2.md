In the [last post](lets-imagine-behaviors.md), we covered the basic plant life cycle. Critters, which is a technical term I tend to use for anything animalistic that wanders about, are a little more complex. Additional movement (idle, wander, hunt/forage/scavenge, hide, evade, pursue) and motivation (security, shelter, hunger, thirst, rest, endurance, reproduction) components must be created for these entities, though many from `plants` can be reused.
