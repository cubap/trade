# Tools Tree

Tools are carried items that augment a pawn's ability to gather, fight, craft, carry, or rest. Most tools have a durability value and degrade with use. Higher-quality crafts (driven by skill level) start at higher durability and provide stronger bonuses.

Tools may be discovered through multiple material paths — for example, a cutting tool can come from knapped stone, a filed bone, or eventually a cast metal blade.

## Rest & Sleep

### Sleeping Mat ✅
> A loose grass weave carried as a comfortable surface for resting on the ground.

- **Discovery:** A poor sleep outcome or unresolved comfort can prompt a dream reflection that reveals the idea.
- **Recipe:** `grass × 1`; no skill prerequisite.
- **Craft practice:** Weaving is the primary skill and gains practice from crafting.
- **Rest bonus:** ×1.3
- **Durability:** 30
- **Enables:**
  - More comfortable rest while the pawn carries the mat
  - A small, actionable progression loop from grass gathering through invention and crafting to improved rest
- **Does not provide:** Shelter or cover; it is a rest surface, not a building.

**Next progression — mat quality 🔮**

- Let the gathered grass mix and the pawn's processing skill influence mat quality.
- Let quality improve comfort and durability, with bounded values and a clear baseline at the current recipe's ×1.3 rest bonus and 30 durability.
- Better comfort can make a dream reflection more effective: improve its chance or the usefulness of the insight, but do not guarantee an invention or bypass its evidence and eligibility rules.
- Keep quality's effects legible in play: a better mat lasts longer and improves rest; better rest creates a stronger opportunity for useful dreaming.
