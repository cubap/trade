# Civic / Industrial Path

The civic-industrial path emerges when pawns establish stable settlements, organise communal labour, and progressively build more sophisticated production infrastructure. It is one of three roughly equal emergent trajectories; the others are [Tribal / Military](tribal-military.md) and [Mercantile / Entrepreneurial](mercantile-entrepreneurial.md).

**Typical emergence conditions:** rich local resources enabling sedentary life, moderate group size, and early luck with construction or planning skills.

---

## Stage 1 — Encampment

Multiple pawns occupy a shared area and begin to coordinate survival.

### Proto-Settlement 🔮
> A social group of 3–5 pawns maintaining co-location around shared shelter.

- **Prerequisites (any one path):**
  - ≥ 3 pawns with average mutual trust > 0.2 AND ≥ 1 shelter structure within radius
  - OR ≥ 5 pawns staying ≥ 3 cycles in the same location with moderate resource richness
  - Cross-path: [Tribal › Territory Claim](tribal-military.md#territory-claim) stabilizes an area for settlement
- **Group type:** `proto_settlement`
- **Enables:**
  - Communal storage threshold check (triggers [Storage Pit](structures.md#storage-pit))
  - [Civic Score](#civic-score) tracking begins
  - Back-pressures planning, construction, and specialization

**Shelter structure** is a class of structure (bedroll, tent, camp, lean-to) that provides comfort and security for rest. It may be portable. The proto-settlement is the social bond — the shared encampment landmark — not the physical footprint.

**Social dynamics:** Lone pawns are biased to camp near others they do not fear. As the group grows, foreigners become less trusted by default. Trust grows through proximity to shared space with resource richness (nearby food, water, and materials above a threshold that prevents desert settlements but allows later-game trade outposts). When the whole social group gains sufficient mutual trust near a resource-rich shelter, the encampment landmark is canonized — discoverable to new pawns and enabling faster growth of physical and social structures.

**Cross-path interactions:** Other branches require minimal civic levels to interact with proto-settlements. A merchant establishing a trading post needs a stable encampment to anchor to. A tribal group offering to guard a wealthy hamlet needs a recognizable social group to contract with.

---

### Communal Storage 🔮
> A shared inventory accessible to all group members, canonizing the encampment landmark.

- **Prerequisites:**
  - Proto-settlement established AND [Structures › Storage Pit](structures.md#storage-pit) built
- **Enables:**
  - Food and material sharing without direct hand-off
  - Surplus accumulation enabling specialization
  - Encampment landmark becomes discoverable to new pawns (faster group growth)
  - Required for [Hamlet](#hamlet) classification

**Canonization:** When communal storage is created at a proto-settlement's encampment landmark, the landmark becomes discoverable to wandering pawns. This enables faster growth of both physical structures (new pawns can find the settlement) and social structures (new pawns can join the group).

---

## Stage 2 — Hamlet

A named place with dedicated production and at least basic infrastructure.

### Hamlet 🔮
> A small permanent settlement with storage and at least 2 specialised structures.

- **Prerequisites:**
  - ≥ 5 pawns with sustained co-location AND communal storage AND stability score above threshold

  - [Governance](#governance) seed
  - Attracts wandering pawns (population growth)
  - Cross-path: Attracts merchants from [Mercantile](mercantile-entrepreneurial.md) path

  - [Civic Reputation](#civic-reputation) system
  - Long-term stability of large groups
  - Cross-path: governance legitimizes [Mercantile › Corporation](mercantile-entrepreneurial.md#corporation) charters

---

### Law Tokens 🔮
> Simple rules stored on the civic ledger: curfew, storage share, tax rate.

- **Prerequisites:**
  - Governance model established AND `planning ≥ 3`
- **Enables:**
  - Formalized resource redistribution
  - Tax collection enabling civic projects
  - Cross-path: Tax revenue can fund [Military Defense Contracts](tribal-military.md#martial-hierarchy)

---

### Civic Reputation 🔮
> A pawn's standing in the settlement based on contributions (building, supplying, defending).

- **Prerequisites:**
  - Governance established AND pawn performs civic contributions
- **Enables:**
  - Influence weight in elective/weighted governance
  - Access to better communal resources
  - Required for senior roles in any governance model

---

## Stage 4 — Town

A large, specialized settlement with multiple production chains and inter-settlement trade.

### Town 🔮
> A settlement with formal boundary, multiple workshops, and market.

- **Prerequisites:**
  - Village established AND [Stone Wall](structures.md#stone-wall) AND [Market](structures.md#market) AND group size ≥ 15

---

## Civic Score

The settlement's civic score aggregates:
- Structure count and variety
- Governance model sophistication
- Stability index (threat, supply regularity, shelter quality)
- Law token compliance rate

A high civic score makes the settlement attractive to merchants and wandering pawns, creating a positive feedback loop.

## Cross-Path Interactions

| Civic development | Interacts with |
|------------------|---------------|
| Proto-settlement | [Military: territory stabilisation](tribal-military.md#territory-claim) |

| Currency | [Mercantile: corporation](mercantile-entrepreneurial.md#corporation) |
| Defence contract | [Military: clan income](tribal-military.md#martial-hierarchy) |

## Back-Pressure Examples

- A pawn who built a lean-to and later encounters clay near the river may recognise an opportunity for a more durable mud hut — construction knowledge back-pressures material discovery.
- A settlement that grows large enough to strain food supply will back-pressure farming and granary construction.
- Repeated conflict with a neighbouring clan motivates wall construction, feeding the masonry skill chain.
