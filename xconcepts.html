    <h2>Concepts</h2>
    <h3 id="time">Time</h3>
    <p>
        Time is simple and regular, mirroring the time on the user's own
        machine. This prevents hunger from being over-managed and sleep from
        becoming inconvenient. When the user is not guiding a character, it
        becomes a sort of NPC, persisting in the world for others to act with
        and perhaps developing skills on its own or acting out a planned routine.
    </p>
    <p>
        It may require some experimenting, but if time is quickened, it should
        a factor of a real day and not so fast that characters rest unrealistically.
        The same patterns will drive the critters that have many of the same needs
        each user-created character attempts to fulfill. As time is persistent
        for each new character, a user is really dropping in on them to see how
        things are going - it should not be uninteresting to operate an entire
        server of zombie characters who may co-evolve.
    </p>
    <h3 id="knowledge+skills">Knowledge and Skills</h3>
    <p>
        Knowledge is gained by observing, experimenting, or conversing with
        other characters. Skills are gained by practicing the actions that
        work towards development. As expected, mastery of some skills may
        be pre-requisite for future advances.
    </p>
    <h4>Exploration Example</h4>
    <p>
        A character who is born <em>tabula rasa</em> has no skills at
        genesis, but may immediately begin to gain experience in two ways:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>As she sits idle, she has time to think and each moment moves
            her closer to unveiling philosophical skills like <code>consideration</code>
            or even <code>imagining</code>. These skills may combine with
            others to allow for <code>experimentation</code> later on.</li>
        <li>More likely, however, is that hunger or insecurity will drive 
            her away from her spawning location. Each new step develops
            <code>exploration</code>, which will then allow explorers to
            <code>look around</code> or <code>remember</code> waypoints and landmarks.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>All these basic skills are developed through simple actions. The character
        who spends more time examining individual objects and interacting with
        them will become more studious and pick up on new properties more
        quickly. She who strikes out quickly hither and yon will be first
        to discover cardinal directions and make maps.
    </p>
    <p>
        Along with these sorts of intellectual developments (as there is no
        real distinction between knowledge and skill levels) there are
        physical consequences of these actions. One who is out and moving
        more quickly hungers, but also develops speed and strength.
    </p>
    <h3 id="politics+civilization">Politics and Civilization</h3>
    <p>The self-organizing principles of the game are four-fold and represent
        the generalized ways communities stave off entropy:</p>
    <dl class="">
        <dt>Tribal from followers:</dt><dd>hunting parties, adventuring groups,
            merchant caravans, military organization</dd>
        <dt>Civil from buildings:</dt><dd>shared structures, citizenship, 
            communal policies</dd>
        <dt>Corporate from businesses:</dt><dd>trade relationships, stock
            exchanges</dd>
        <dt>Cultural from schools, guilds, art houses:</dt><dd>guilds,
            apprenticeships, bards</dd>
    </dl>
    <p>These general groups are similar to knowledge and skills, but 
        require more than one character to realize. In this way, complex
        organizations may find themselves with unique options (standing
        army, university) that require sufficient group experience in several
        areas.</p>
    <h4 id="tribal">Tribal</h4>
    <p>A character who battles a lot may simply be a mercenary, hero, or smuggler;
        by grouping with others on shared goals, experience toward real 
        organization (<code>follow</code>, <code>obey orders</code>) can
        happen, allowing for AI overrides and basic hegemony.</p>
    <p>Players with enough skill can <code>follow</code> to let another 
        physically lead the pathfinding and eventually <code>take orders</code>.
        A commander with enough skill can <code>give orders</code>, even if the
        ordered player is less experienced.</p>
    <p>Promotions are natural as leadership complicates. Not relying on
        physical structures, all grouping is nomadic or ad hoc and can be
        violent or nonviolent such as simple groups for gathering, trade
        caravans or hunting parties, adventuring groups, and raiding 
        parties. More than 5 followers may begin to subdivide.</p>
    <h5 id="commands-in-a-tribal-path">Commands in a tribal path</h5>
    <ul>
        <li><code>Follow</code> (character, animal) - physical path tracing 
            to be in the same place and mirror control of directions. Related
            to <code>tracking</code>.</li>
        <li><code>Mark</code> (target) - tag a mutually visible object for 
            attention by followers. Related to <code>attack</code>,
            <code>gather</code>, <code>unload</code>, <code>load</code>,
            <code>protect</code>.</li>
        <li><code>Attack</code> (target) - command remote character to
            assault target using independent AI for determination.</li>
        <li><code>Gather</code> (target) - mark a specific resource for
            collection.</li>
        <li><code>Gather</code> (type) - find specified resource nearby 
            and return to group or cache.</li>
        <li><code>Protect</code> (target) - defend a person, resource, or
            location.</li>
        <li><code>Obey</code> (character) - transfer trust of leadership to
            another from a group.</li>
        <li><code>(Un)load</code> (inventory, cache) - move in and out
            of a designated cache.</li>
    </ul>
    <h5 id="skills-in-a-tribal-path">Skills in a tribal path</h5>
    <p>Skills allow certain commands and grant bonuses to group events beyond the advantage of numbers.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><code>Lead</code></li>
        <li><code>Direct</code></li>
        <li><code>Organize</code></li>
        <li><code>Schedule</code></li>
        <li><code>Command</code></li>
        <li><code>Tactics</code></li>
        <li><code>Assault</code></li>
        <li><code>Siege</code></li>
        <li><code>Settle</code></li>
    </ul>
    <h4 id="civil">Civil</h4>
    <p>When a permanent structure is built, civics begins to accumulate.
        5 households in the same place (each has at least 2 within 15 
        meters and is within 30 meters of the center) may allow for some
        laws and organization.</p>
    <p>Administrative positions exist within a city and can be more 
        formalized as it grows. Administrative buildings grant further 
        commands and bonuses. These collaborative buildings can be very 
        functional for characters (city hall, firehouse) or direct city
        improvements (streets, walls). In smaller villages, individuals 
        will freely contribute skills, but a city can have its own treasury
        and supply goods and pay for work, etc.</p>
    <p>Laws in a city will start with recognition of citizenship. Some 
        trust and reputation comes just from sharing citizenship (or 
        enemiesâ€¦). Eventually laws can include curfews, taxes, tolls, 
        tariffs. Some leader character will decide these and (eventually)
        decide whether it goes to a consensus or vote.</p>
    <p>Townships may eventually need to mint a currency to standardize
        exchanges and taxes. Before the mint, a village leader will 
        artificially set exchange rates for tradeable resources, especially
        those which are needed for structures. Contributing to the town is
        reflected in the civic reputation for the character and may be key
        in elections or minimum standards for citizenship benefits.
        Exchanging for payable taxes at a banker (chicken for wood, 
        for example) who sets certain values and stockpiles the trades. 
        Backed script is then possible and is redeemable at these 
        locations.</p>
    <p>Once cities grow to a size that they can support a city planner
        or streets department, paths around the town boundaries can be 
        paved as well. This can benefit movement for trade, military, 
        or simple mobility. Several cities may even collaborate and 
        share plans to build it and enhance their civic relationship 
        as a result.</p>
    <h4 id="corporate">Corporate</h4>
    <p>A sale happens as early as the first trade. Once a character trades
        a stick for a snack, she may be on her way to becoming a stick-seller.
        Once she sets up a shop, this becomes more formalized, as others
        know where to come for their sticks. Shops have a limited inventory,
        so they are likely to start as general goods and grow into grocers,
        building supplies, weaponsmiths, etc. The earliest shop is just a
        trading post, since there is no money. Characters will exchange 
        their surplus for specific needs at the shop at a rate set by the 
        shopkeeper. These exchange rates allow for "fair pricing" even while
        in AI mode. If the keeper is out - an offer can be made (offer range,
        if haggling) that the keeper can respond to when available (or set a
        default time to accept or reject).</p>
    <aside class="alert alert-info pull-right col-sm-4 col-lg-3 hidden-xs">
        At first, subsistence will be key, 
        but shops will grow as characters begin to specialize in trades
        and spend time in that way (gathering, crafting, smithing, farming).
        This covers goods (stock) primarily, since services will require 
        some different logic.</aside>
    <p>The infrastructure for the economy will grow as well. A player who
        collects sticks all day and sells them the next will soon accept
        a lower price for goods in one shop to wholesale them. Alternately,
        a shopkeeper may be born when the same player decides to pay a less
        experienced player to gather sticks for them. If a courier spends 
        enough time traveling between caches, he may become a merchant. 
        Someone who decides to map out the different exchange rates at
        various shops and move goods to turn a profit may become a very
        rich stock day trader.</p>
    <p>Support structures are raised around businesses for their protection 
        and efficient operation. A courier may make do with a basket or a 
        wheelbarrow, but a distance requires a horse or wagon. At each level,
        a more advanced skill to build is needed. A corporation will bundle
        several businesses together, with special rates and some control over
        the supply chain. A managed forest may supply great lumber that is
        only accessible at one wholesaler in large lots, so the final shops
        for individuals will have a higher price unless others can supply. 
        In this way, "private" property can have a very civil relationship
        when it comes to land deeds and plots or paying for the cityâ€™s
        protection from raiders or supporting laws that punish theft or
        damage to property.</p>
    <p>Groups of shops can agree to fix prices and avoid speculators, 
        day traders, or fluctuations from flooding the market in one area.
        Block bargaining may fetch better prices and lead to corporate 
        (or cooperative) formations. Shops may start to trade in store credit
        and allow players to trade for credit that can be used at other
        stores as well, even if the township doesn't yet have a currency.
        In this way, currency may emerge from civil caches and banks
        and from corporate economic organization.</p>
    <h4 id="cultural">Cultural</h4>
    <p>Education and guilds make up the service industry. At a simple 
        level, one character may tell information (story, landmark location,
        gossip), show a skill (dance, sing, teach), or performs a task 
        (protect, carry, clerk) for another character. For a bard (poet, 
        historian) this may be stories of deeds, resource locations, prices
        in another area. For a scout, this may be terrain information and
        troop movements.</p>
    <p>With the addition of some resources, services become crafting. One
        may hire a carpenter to build a house or furniture out of resources
        on hand. Also, a furniture store may employ a carpenter full-time 
        to supply the stock. At some level, even couriers are a type of 
        service industry.</p>
    <p>A guild structure allows for education and apprenticeship. Experience
        can be gained in tutelage for skills otherwise inaccessible. This 
        is especially important for something interdisciplinary. For example,
        some musical skill may be needed for a furniture-maker to begin
        constructing musical instruments, but once it is learned it can be
        taught without the same prerequisites.</p>
    <p>With higher levels in military or civics, other services become
        available. A policeman protects civic interests as a character, 
        but also may need a badge, uniform, weapon. A teacher may learn
        many basic skills to share out and increase the quality of life
        or speed of learning through experience for others. A newsman
        may effectively gather information and report it out, but then
        need a printer and paper mill to increase circulation. A player
        with artistic skills and good communication can paint signs for
        storefronts, wayfinding, or public information.</p>
    <p>Combined with corporations, a crafter or service character can be
        the official workshop for a group. A town may appoint posts
        (paid or not) so that new members or visitors can easily find 
        their way around. "Help wanted" will become the default place for
        (un)skilled workers to find "quests".</p>
    <h3 id="industry">Industry</h3>
    <p>Major industries include things with a significant startup investment
        and that are helped by complex machinery or skilled labor, but 
        cheap and plentiful raw materials.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Milling - Grain to flour, wood to lumber, stone to grit 
            (of types)</li>
        <li>Smithing - crafting from metal (stone, wood), especially 
            advanced weapons and tools</li>
        <li>Farming - basic foods are easy to find and forage, but takes
            time</li>
        <li>Shopkeeping - for timesaving and avoiding direct trading
            for goods as well as obtaining exotic materials or goods</li>
        <li>Textiles - simple woven or processed fabrics from grass,
            fibers, and skins</li>
    </ul>
    <p>A new character to an already developed area can start out by
        gathering any of these or apprenticing, if desired. If a character
        is in an area where this is not available, milling or textiles
        would come only with experience on a small scale; smithing could
        be learned and improved from building tools; farming takes
        experience with gathering; and shopkeeping is super-trading.</p>
    <p>More advanced industries may include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Smelting - processing raw ores into more usable, higher quality forms and alloys</li>
        <li>Stock trading - moving large quantities of goods around the map</li>
        <li>Banking - storing and exchanging goods for taxes, shopping, or loans</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="fighting">Fighting</h3>
    <aside class="alert alert-info pull-right col-sm-4 col-lg-3 hidden-xs">
        <p>Turn-based, asynchronous initiative, automated with interrupt.
            Range considerations, movement, actions, free action, stamina
            cost. THAC0, DAM based on skills, wearables, and item used, 
            aiming. Resistance based on health, skills (evade, etc.), 
            stamina. In most cases, KO is real, but kill must be finished.</p>
        <p>Fleeing and pursuit is just a stamina vs. skills game. Instinct
            may prevent desired action until fighting skills are gained</p>
    </aside>
    <p>Fighting is resource-expensive and not intended to be primary
        to <span class="label label-primary">Trade</span>. Obviously,
        combat will resolve hunting or surviving wildlife. PvP is not
        specifically disallowed, but is considered a hostile act and has
        a negative impact on reputation. That said, most weaponry may be able
        to quickly incapacitate, but an intentional finishing blow is
        called for to make a kill. Though this may be a bit of a nerf, 
        it will allow for muggings and general banditry without leaving a
        trail of bodies.</p>
    <h4>Using Weapons</h4>
    <p>
        Inventory controls should keep from carrying tons of weapons,
        but most characters might keep a ranged and melee weapon handy. First
        attack may require readying a weapon and switching may require
        putting one away or just dropping it (free action) and pulling 
        out another.
    </p>
    <p>
        A player with stone skills can pick up a stone or stone+ weapon 
        easily. In fact, if the player does not know how to build it,
        it should be very easy to reverse engineer (albeit at low quality).
        Other related categories need to be identified as well, like good 
        with a hammer should help with an axe. Vertical categories should
        also be linked. Good with a stone axe probably means good with a
        metal axe and probably means there is some skill with a metal hammer.
        Some weapons will have steeper learning curves and low quality will
        inhibit fast skill advancement.
    </p>
    <p>
        Buying a weapon way out of your league may work out, but will 
        require a lot of practice, exponential to the skill dearth. If
        the gap is big enough, the character may not even recognize the
        weapon as one and may hurt themselves in the attempt. Some 
        parallel skills may help: a hunter may find it easy to pick up
        a longbow: a woodsman can use a battleaxe better than average;
        a butcher may have skills with a chopping sword, but not a 
        rapier; a farmer may actually carry a fork like a trident for
        defense and with better effect because of the skill with it.
