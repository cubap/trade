# Structures Tree

Structures are placeable entities that persist in the world, provide buffs to nearby pawns, and signal civilisational development. Most structures can be reached via multiple material paths — the same functional outcome (shelter, storage, production) may be achievable with woven fibres, timber, clay, or stone, though durability and maintenance costs differ.

Structures degrade over time unless maintained. A pawn familiar with a more durable construction technique may recognise the limitations of an existing structure and be back-pressured to upgrade it.

## Shelters

### Basic Shelter ✅
> A simple angled windbreak of sticks bound with fiber and cordage (lean-to).

- **Prerequisites:**
  - `construction_basics ≥ 1` AND `stick × 8, fiber × 4, cordage × 2`

- **Capacity:** 2 pawns
- **Rest bonus:** ×1.3
- **Deterioration:** standard rate
- **Enables:**
  - Structure exposure triggers `construction_basics` for nearby pawns
  - Back-pressures recognition of better materials (clay, stone, timber)
  - Required for [Civic › Proto-Settlement](civic-industrial.md#proto-settlement) formation threshold
