# Copilot Worklog

## 2026-02-23

- Consolidated scattered markdown documentation into canonical files under `docs/`
- Created persistent Copilot context under `.copilot/context.md`
- Marked transient implementation/session summary docs for removal
- Implemented learnable memory clustering, route planning, social memory sharing, revisit confidence decay, and observed-success route weighting
- Implemented broad resource specialization by domain (including agriculture class transfer for seeds/soils) and intent-aware stick/wood discernment for value appraisal
- Documented additional specialization and mercantile-path opportunities as future considerations in docs
- Synthesized recurring ideas from `docs/TradeGameNotes.pdf` into canonical occupation/economy documentation
- Formalized Tribe/Town/Traders framing and occupation-focused priorities in docs and persistent context

Use this file for future short-lived execution logs. Promote durable outcomes into `docs/`.
