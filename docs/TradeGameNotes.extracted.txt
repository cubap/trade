Politics and Civilization in the Trade Game:
- Military from Followers / Leaders, nomadic tribe organization.
- Civil from Buildings, structural advances / upgrades.
- Corporate from businesses and trade relationships.
- Educational from schools, guilds, apprenticeships.

Military (tribal?):
An individual who battles a lot may simply be a mercenary, hero or smuggler, by grouping with others (Share goals) experience towards real organization (Follow, obey orders) can happen, allowing AI overrides and basic hierarchy. Players with enough skill can (Follow) to let another physically lead and eventually (Take orders). A commander with enough skill can (Give orders) even if the receiving player is less experienced. Promotions are natural as leadership complicates. Without structures, all grouping is nomadic and can be "military" without violence and can also be hunting parties for food, people groups for gathering, trade caravans, etc. Once the X(??) follows begins to subdivide.

Commands (not skills)
- Follow(est physical path tracing to be in the same place and mirror control of directions (related: tracking)
- Attack(target) command remote player to assault target with its own AT. For determination Maybe just mark target (related: fight)
- Mark(target) Identify a mutual object for attention by followers.
- Gather(target) Mark + gather resource, return (related skill to gather)
- Gather(type) Find resource nearby or return (related skills to gather)
- Protect(target) Defend a person, resource, location, weapon
- Obey(person) Transfer trust and leadership to another for a group
- (Unload inventory) Move in and out of a designated cache.

Skills: Lead Direct Organize Schedule
Command Tactics Assault Siege Settler
Skills allow certain commands and grant bonuses to group events beyond the advantage of numbers.

Civil: (Building-centric developments)
When a permanent structure is built, civics starts to happen. A few (5 match military groups) households in the same place may allow for some laws and organization. Administrative positions exist within a city and can be more formalized as it grows. Administrative buildings grant further commands and bonuses. These collaborative buildings can be very functional for player (city hall, firehouse) or direct city improvements (streets, walls). In smaller villages, individuals will consolidate skill, but a city will have its own treasury. Laws in a city will start with recognition of citizenship. Some trust and reputation comes just from sharing citizenship (or enemies...). Eventually laws can include curfews, taxes, tolls, tariffs. Some leader player will decide these and (eventually) decide whether it goes to consensus or vote.
Townships may eventually need to mint a currency to standardize exchanges and taxes. Before the mint, a village leader will artificially set exchange rates for tradeable resources, especially those which are needed for structures. Contributing to the town is reflected in the civic reputation for the player and may be key in elections or minimum standards for citizenship benefits. Exchanging for payable taxes at a banker (chicken for wood for example) who sets certain values and stockpiles the trades. Backed script is then possible and is redeemable at these locations.

Once cities grow to a size and have streets department. Paths around the border can be paved as well. This can benefit movement for trade, military or simple mobility. Once the structure is laid art, several cities can collaborate to build it and may even begin to have civic relationships as a result.

Corporate: The business of trade.
A sale happens as early as the first trade. If I trade you a stick for a snack, I may be on my way to becoming a stick-seller. Once I set up a shop, this is formalized. Shops have limited inventory so they are likely to start as general goods and grow into grocers, building supply, weaponsmiths, etc. The earliest shop is a trading post, since there is no money. Players will exchange their surplus for specific needs at the shop at a rate set by the shop keeper. These exchange rates allow for "fair pricing" even while in AI mode. If the keeper is out - an offer can be made (offer range if haggling) that the keeper can respond to when available (or set a default reject or accept). At first, substitute will be key but shops will grow as players begin to specialize in trades and spend time in that way. This covers goods (stock) primarily, since services will have different logic.
The infrastructure for the economy will grow as well. A player who collects sticks all day and sells them the next will soon accept a lower price for goods in one shop to wholesale them. Alternately a shopkeeper may be born when the same player decides to pay a less experienced player to gather sticks for them. If a courier spends enough time travelling between caches, he may become a merchant. Someone who decides to map out the different

exchange rates at various shops to turn a profit may become a very rich day trader.
Support structures are raised around businesses for their protection and efficient operation. A courier may make do with a basket or wheelbarrow, but a distance requires a horse or wagon. At each level, a more advanced skill to build is needed. A corporation will bundle several businesses together, with special rates and some control over the supply chain. A managed forest may supply great lumber that is only accessible at one wholesaler in large lots so the final shops for individuals will have a higher price unless others can supply. In this way, "private property" can have a very civil relationship when it comes to land deeds and plots or paying for the city's protection from raiders or supporting laws that punish theft or damage to property.
Groups of shops can agree to fix prices and avoid speculators, day traders, or fluctuations from flooding the market in one area. Black market dealings may fetch better prices and lead to corporate formation. Unsavory shops may start to trade in store credit and allow players to trade for credit that can be used at other stores as well. In this way currency may emerge from civil charter and banks or from corporate economic organization.
Education and guilds make up the service industry. At a simple level one player may tell information, show a skill, or perform a task for another player. For a bard (poet, history) this may be stories of deeds, resource locations, prices in another area. For a scout, this may be terrain information and troop movements. With the addition of some resources, services become crafting,

--- Page 5 ---
One may hire a carpenter to build a house or furniture out of resources on-hand or a furniture store may employ a carpenter full-time to supply the stocks. At some level, even couriers are a type of service industry.
A guild structure (Corporate) allows for education and apprenticeship. Experience can be gained in tutelage for skill otherwise inaccessible. This is especially important for something interdisciplinary. For example, some musical skill may be needed for a furniture-maker to begin constructing instruments, but once that is learned it can be taught with higher levels in military or civics, other services become available. A policeman protects civic interests as a player but also needs a badge, uniform, weapons. A teacher may learn many basic skills to share out and increase the quality of life or speed of learning through experience for others. A newsman may effectively gather information and report it out, but they need a printer and paper mill to really get the word out. A player with artistic skills and good communication can paint signs for storefronts, wayfinding, or public information.
Combined with corporations a crafter or service person can be the official for some group. A town may appoint posts (paid or not) so that new members or visitors can easily find their way around. "Help wanted" will become the default place for unskilled workers to field quests.
