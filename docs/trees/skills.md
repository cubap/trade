# Skills Tree

Skills are capability ratings (0–100) that unlock new goals, recipes, and social roles. They are gained through practice, observation, teaching, and pondering. Skill decay applies to unused skills over time (configurable via `InventionConfig.js`).

Each entry lists the conditions that cause the skill to **first become available** (unlock), not the conditions needed to level it up — levelling happens naturally through use.
