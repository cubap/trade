# Materials Tree

Materials are the raw and processed substances that feed crafting recipes, building projects, and trade. Discovery of a new material type typically widens a pawn's awareness of what is possible, creating back-pressure toward related skills and tools.

## Material Groups (for Lateral Discovery)

The crafting system recognises material *groups*. When a pawn knows a recipe using one material and encounters another in the same group, they may spontaneously ponder substitution:

| Group | Members |
|-------|---------|
| `fibers` | grass, fiber, linen, plant_fiber |
| `stones` | rock, stone, flint, obsidian |
| `woods` | stick, timber, plank, bamboo |
| `hides` | hide, leather, cloth, bark |
| `metals` | copper, tin, iron, bronze |
| `herbs` | herb, root, bark_strip, mushroom |
| `clays` | clay, fired_brick, ceramic |
