# Civilization and Social Systems Roadmap

## Objective

Enable emergent multi-branch civilization behavior across clan, civic, merchant, and guild pathways.

## Branch Model

- **Military/Clan**: defense, escort, territory pressure response
- **Civil/Government**: settlement formation, governance, civic stability
- **Corporate/Merchant**: route economics, trade entities, contracts
- **Educational/Guild**: teaching loops, apprenticeships, knowledge diffusion

## Foundations (Phase 0)

- Social bond tracking with decay
- Group formation thresholds and lightweight group persistence
- Branch inclination vectors per pawn
- Macro-goal selection bias from inclination and local context

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Military/Clan

- Party commands (follow/protect/scout/mark)
- Coordinated hunt and escort behavior
- Territory and tactical memory loops

### Phase 2: Civil/Government

- Structure clustering to detect proto-settlements
- Communal storage and simple job board behavior
- Early governance tokens and civic reputation scoring

### Phase 3: Corporate/Merchant

- Trade offer model and rolling price averages
- Shop entity behavior and route planning
- Security hiring contracts

### Phase 4: Educational/Guild

- Teaching action with diminishing-return transfer
- Guild formation and curriculum events
- Publication artifacts that improve nearby invention outcomes

## Cross-Branch Interoperability

- Contract types: escort, defense, supply, research
- Inter-group reputation affecting contract rates
- Event hooks: raids, markets, festivals, disasters
- User influence via priorities, injected goals, and resource valuation

## Metrics and Performance

- Stability index, trade value flow, learning velocity
- Capped rolling windows for event aggregation
- Periodic decay passes for scores and cohesion

## MVP Slice Order

1. Bonds and pair/party formation
2. Clan hunting with follow/protect
3. Settlement detection and communal storage
4. Basic trading and local price averaging
5. Teaching action with guild seeding
6. Inclination-weighted macro-goal selection
