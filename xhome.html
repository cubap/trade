        <h2>It Seems</h2>
        <p>Current MMOs are crowded with characters who
            are deadlocked on a personal storyline. The MUDs of old encouraged users
            to interact and contribute not just in a specific quest or raid but for
            mutual benefit and social fulfillment. As chat rooms became fantastic
            worlds we see more and more of our avatars and less and less of each other.

    <p class="lead"> 
        <span class="label label-primary">Trade</span> is a game that allows a user
        to coach a character through advanced development. It is a survival game in
        which characters find new ways to thrive.</p>
    <p>
        At the beginning of each character's life they find themselves 
        (predictably) alone and generally unequipped. Through observation
        and practice, skills are developed, specific properties are learned,
        and self-selected goals are reached. Decisions made on behalf of
        a character will instruct the automated behaviors that drive all
        unprescribed actions. Interactions with other characters will open
        the way for cooperative skills and goals.
    </p>
    <h3>Basics</h3>
    <p>
        All entities in the <span class="label label-primary">Trade</span>
        world act with an intelligence. Each strives to survive, grow,
        and thrive based on some universal goals and a few specific ones.
        When a user is playing, her will suppresses (to some extent) the
        will of the active character.
